Linux requirements:
* xdotool. However, xdotool is a Linux command-line tool. To install it, you would need to use the package manager for your specific Linux distribution.

For example, if you're using a Debian-based distribution (like Ubuntu), you can install xdotool by running:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install xdotool

Or, if you're using an RPM-based distribution (like Fedora), you can install it by running:

bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install xdotool
